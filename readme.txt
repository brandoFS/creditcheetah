This Android app takes a credit card (including expiration date and CVV) as input and uses the Luhn algorithmn to dertermine whether or not the card number is valid. It then displays a message to the user indicating if the validation was successful. 

This could be expanded in the future to do something with the credit card information, currently it is not being saved in any way. 

Supports the following Major Card Companies:

JCB 
MasterCard
